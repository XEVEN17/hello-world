# hello-world
trying to learn all this 12/23/22
- The instruction guide told me to write about myself and use markdown elements
  While I do not yet know how to use all these markdown elements I am sure I can write a little about myself. 
 I came here to github so I could open/see files from another site. It is obvious I am completely lost as to how to open a file and view it. 
- There was a zipped folder that would not save/open, when I opened it there are six more files or pages that appear to contain jibberish instead of what I am looking to view.
- I am thinking I need to find the code of the material I want to view and then somehow upload it into github or python in order to view it, each time I think I have found the code, copy and paste it into the run cell it is giving me all types of errors - invalid syntax, not defined... 
- I am not seeing any live help options where someone might get logged on with me here on my computer and at least show me the ropes to get started.
